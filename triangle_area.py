'''

1. What is the flow of the program? Which line of code kicks off the process?

I feel that the second line of this code kicks off the process becasue it is the first line 
asking for user input, and without that input the program would not be able to output a 
correct answer.

2. What was the hardest part of this lab?

The hardest of the part of this lab was to remeber to use the float funtion to make 
sure the integer can be multiplied by the text.
